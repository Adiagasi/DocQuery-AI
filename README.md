✨ DocQuery-AI

📄 Ask your documents questions — and get answers you can trust.

DocQuery-AI is a document-based Question Answering project built with LLMs, embeddings, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
It allows users to ask natural language questions and receive accurate answers strictly grounded in the uploaded documents.

🚀 What’s This Project About?

Built as part of an NLP course, this project focuses on:

Reducing hallucinations

Designing reliable prompt-based AI systems

Turning documents into an interactive knowledge source

🧠 How It Works (In Short)

Documents are processed and converted into embeddings

User questions are matched to relevant document sections

The LLM generates answers only from retrieved content

Simple, effective, and grounded.
